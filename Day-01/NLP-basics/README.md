# Day 1 â€” NLP Preprocessing Basics

## ðŸ”‘ Learning Goals

Understand what NLP preprocessing is and why it matters in generative AI.

Learn about:

- Tokenization
- Stemming & Lemmatization
- Stopword removal
- Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)

## ðŸ’» What You'll Do

- Run tokenization on sample text.
- Compare stemming vs lemmatization.
- Remove stopwords from sentences.
- Do POS tagging using NLTK.
- Run Named Entity Recognition using spaCy.

## ðŸš€ Challenge for Learners

- Take a paragraph from Wikipedia, preprocess it, and print cleaned tokens.
- Compare results between NLTK and spaCy.
