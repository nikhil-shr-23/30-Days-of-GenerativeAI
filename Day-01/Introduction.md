# Introduction to Generative AI

Generative AI is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new and original content, such as images, music, and text, using algorithms and models. It is a subset of AI that is trained on large datasets to generate new data that resembles the training data.

In this course, we will explore the fundamentals of generative AI, including the different types of models, techniques for training and optimizing models, and the ethical considerations surrounding the use of AI in various applications.

We will also discuss the current state of generative AI and its potential future developments. By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of the principles and techniques of generative AI, and be able to apply them to your own projects and research.

So let's dive in straight away. ðŸš€
